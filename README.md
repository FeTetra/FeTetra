# Hello! I am FeTetra! :3
## I am a relatively bad programmer, but I have experience in several languages (as listed below).

### Scripting Languages:
- Python
- Bash
- Batch
- JavaScript

### Markup and Web-Design:
- HTML
- CSS
- XML

### Compiled Languages:
- C
- C++
- Go
- C#

### Assembly Languages:
- Fishfingers (don't ask)

### Random Languages:
- Nix

## What do I do with this?
### Not much. 
But I'm trying to contribute to some projects so I can utilize some of the skills I've picked up in my free time! 
Most of my programming experience is spent on personal projects, which may never get completed or see the light of day outside of my SSD.
I spend a lot of my time doing other things I'm passionate about, like making music!
